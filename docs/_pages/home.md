## Build Better Business Software by Telling and Visualizing Stories

![A domain story showing the process of going to the movies](/images/home/metropolis-1-animated.gif){: .align-right width="50%"}

Storytelling is at the heart of human communicationâ€”why not use it to overcome costly misunderstandings when designing software? By telling and visualizing stories, domain experts and team members make business processes and domain knowledge tangible. Domain Storytelling enables everyone to understand the relevant people, activities, and work items.

Domain Storytelling is a technique to transform domain knowledge into effective business software. It ***brings together domain experts and development teams***.

## Purposes

Domain Storytelling is a versatile tools that helps you to:

- Understand the domain of a software system
- Find microservices boundaries
- Talk about requirements
- Fully align all project participants and stakeholders, both technical and business-focused
- Draw clear boundaries to organize your domain, software, and teams
Transform domain knowledge into requirements, embedded naturally into an agile process
- Gain better visibility into your IT landscape so you can consolidate or optimize it

We let domain experts tell us stories about their tasks. While listening, we record the stories using an easy-to-understand pictographic language.

The domain experts can see immediately whether we understand their story correctly. After very few stories, we are able to talk about the people, processes, and events in that domain.
